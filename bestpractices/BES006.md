# BES006 Compose with reuse in mind

When constructing the domain model, employ a "reuse strategy" by modularising the design across different resources: CDS files in the project and from other projects, NPM modules, plugins and so on. Start with and take inspiration from the built-in common types and aspects package.

## Outcome

Your model remains light, and you gain consistency across your projects, as well as a reduction of maintenance effort. You can make use of pre-built scenarios instead of having to invent them yourself.
