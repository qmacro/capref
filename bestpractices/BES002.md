# BES002 Think local-first

Throughout your project, especially in the early stages, think local-first in
terms of development. Avoid trying to "boil the ocean" and, instead, connect to
remote databases, systems and services, and use CAP's mock features as capable
substitutes.

## Outcome

Your development iteration cycles will be faster and you can focus on the
domain model and implementing any necessary implementations for services
without having to deal with the complexities of real connections or rely upon a
permanent network connection.

Reproducing issues and onboarding new collaborators will be easier without the
need to connect to a remote system, exchange credentials, or manage system
access.
