# BES003 Embrace convention over configuration

The framework has many features that "just work" if you only adopt how they are
set up. Instead of creating explicit configuration to bend the framework to
your will, embrace the conventions.

## Outcome

You will have to create and maintain less configuration, your projects will
work as expected by your fellow developers, and you will be able to focus on
the important aspects of design and implementation.
