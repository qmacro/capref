# BES007 Provide public entry points to reuse packages

Add an `index.cds` to the root of any reuse package you create, to act as a
public entry point. This follows the common practice found in e.g. Node.js with
`index.js`, and with traditional Web servers (such as Apache's `httpd`).

## Outcome

Use can be made of your reuse package by referring to it by its name alone, providing
clean interface and expected behavior.
