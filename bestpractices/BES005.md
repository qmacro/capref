# BES005 Factor out separate concerns

Separate concerns by factoring them out into sections, files or modules. Keep
technical concerns separate from your domain logic.

## Outcome

Your domain model remains clean and focused on the business logic. Technical
details can be managed independently, making your models easier to read,
maintain, and evolve over time.
