# Prefer flat models

When modeling the domain, avoid the temptation to over-burden the design, and the domain experts, with complex structures. Instead, aim for flat models where possible.

## Outcome

Models are easier to understand and reason about, with the result that your domain experts remain in the loop and can continue to provide value. Additionally, flat and simple models are more amenable to reuse.
