# BES004 Follow domain modeling naming conventions

Follow the naming conventions for the different building blocks in CDS models.
For example entity names should be capitalized and plural, element names should
start with lower case, and so on.

## Outcome

CDS models are simpler to read in general, and the building blocks are easier
to distinguish from one another.
