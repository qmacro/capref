# BES008 Have your code formatted

A CAP project will consist of content in multiple languages, such as CDL (in
CDS files) and either JavaScript or Java. A developer spends much more time
reading code than writing it, and to this end, it's preferable to have
consistent formatting. So make sure your code is formatted in a consistent way.
Use the formatting facilities in your editor, or use the command line tool
provided.

## Outcome

Consistently formatted code is easier to read and comprehend. Not only will
this lend improvements to CAP projects in general, but it will also mean that
you may more likely get answers to your questions on forums, if you take the
time to make it straightforward for the readers to ingest.
