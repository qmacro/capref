# FEA001 Mock data

Use the mock data feature to get started with your own, or system-generated,
test data. This can be in the form of CSV or JSON and through convention over
configuration will be automatically deployed to your design time persistence
layer.

## Benefit

Being local-first, your development loop can be tight and you can iterate on
data related explorations and features faster.
