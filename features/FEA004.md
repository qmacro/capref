# FEA004 Extend models

After defining an entity, you can still extend it with additional elements
and annotations. Use the `extend` directive to add new elements and use
the `annotate` directive to add or modify annotations. This applies to entities
defined in your own models as well as those imported from external modules.

## Outcome

Any modifications are available to all consumers of the original entity.
This allows extending functionality without modifying the original definition,
promoting reuse and modularity in your CDS models.
