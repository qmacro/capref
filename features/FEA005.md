# FEA005 Declarative constraints

A common requirement is to validate incoming data. With declarative constraints
one can define the validation criteria at the CDS model layer. Such constraints
are expressed in the CDS Expression Language (CXL).

## Benefit

This means that less custom code needs to be written and maintained, custom
code that would otherwise have to exist to do the same validation work.
Moreover, defining constraints in the CDS model means that they can be
determined, discussed and refined at the right time (during project design) and
by the right people (not least the domain experts).
