# FEA003 Mock remote services

When a remote service is included as part of your project, and you have
imported its definition, you can have that service mocked. There are two
approaches, implicit, where the CAP server will mock the service in-process,
and explicit, where you can run a second CAP server to serve the service,
mocked, on a separate socket.

## Outcome

Mocking the required remote services means that you don't have to spend time
with connection and access configuration, and the ceremony that goes with it.
You're also not dependent on that remote service being available or even
existing. This in turn means that you can retain a tight development loop and
control the services end to end. You can also have the mocked remote services
serve data - see [FEA002 Mock data](../features/FEA002.md).
