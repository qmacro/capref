# FEA002 Mock auth

The CAP framework offers various auth strategies, including ones that support
JWT, XSUAA and IAS based solutions. It also offers the mock
strategy where Basic Authentication is used in combination with a simple list
of pre-defined users and roles, which you can add to to suit your domain and
authentication & authorization modeling.

## Outcome

Using mock auth means that you can retain a tight development loop while not
missing out on the inclusion of auth requirements (with the requisite
annotations) in your modeling, instead of putting this layer off until later.
