# FEA006 Status-transition flows

In an enterprise context, it's not unusual for an app to have to
maintain status, and allow controlled transition between different
status values according to business data circumstances & user
activities. Use status-transition flows to model, control, validate and
execute such transitions. The modeling is defined declaratively at the
CDS level.

## Benefit

Modeling declaratively at the CDS level means a drastic reduction (often
to zero) of any custom coding for such requirements. It also means that
the possible transitions are decided upon and shared with the domain
expert at design time. As well as controlling changes to the status
values, the CAP framework also takes care of generating annotations so
that the appropriate transition actions can be made available to the user
in the UI, automatically.
