# AXI004 Services are cheap

A CDS model typically consists of a schema layer, closest to the persistence
level, with entities and the relationships between them, with CDS model files
usually being found in the `db/` directory. One layer up, in `srv/`, is where
we can and should think about the interfaces we might want to create for access
to the schema layer artifacts. This axiom conveys the idea that we can and
should define different services for different purposes and use cases, such as
UI-focused access, or an API package, or any other facade that might be
required or desired.

In other words, don't create one single service to rule
them all, define multiple services that each have different restrictions, are
carried via different protocols, and expose different combinations of
artifacts.
