# AXM001 What not how

Use the declarative approach to express your intent; describe what you want,
not how it should be realised.

## Outcome

The surface area of your app remains as small as possible, with fewer moving
parts. A default implementation for the intent that you express is more often
than not already provided by the CAP framework.
