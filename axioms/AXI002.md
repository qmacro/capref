# AXI002 Less is more

Be concise, avoid unnecessary complexity; write less code to achieve more.

A smaller code base is easier to read and maintain. There are fewer moving
parts that can break or cause bugs. New collaborators can onboard more easily.
Lower cognitive load for humans and smaller context size for LLMs.
