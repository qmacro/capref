# AXI001 What not how

Use the declarative approach to express your intent; describe what you want,
not how it should be realised. Alternatively known as "declare more, code
less".

The surface area of your app remains as small as possible, with fewer moving
parts. A default implementation for the intent that you express is more often
than not already provided by the CAP framework. The less code you write, the
smaller the surface area is for bugs to appear, and the fewer chances there are
for you to do something wrong.
