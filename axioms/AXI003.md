# AXI003 Convention over configuration

Some frameworks need a lot of up-front configuration, and you must be explicit
in describing everything you want to happen. Others have a layer of default
behavior that is both sensible and usually what you want. Often, that layer of
default behavior indirectly represents the philosophy of the framework and
helps lay the foundation for best practices.

Fighting convention by overriding default behavior could be a sign that you're
not embracing the framework's philosophy, eschewing best practices, and making
more work for yourself and your team.
